### What this does?:
This Python code defines a script that filters JSON lines based on specific words and writes the filtered lines to an output file. 
Basically, this will remove any political bias or refusal statements from JSON datasets. For educational purposes only, my friends.

### How to use?:
This will write a new JSON file with this file name: **{current_time}-UNCENSORED.json**
```batch
python uncensor.py any-json.json
```
